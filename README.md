# World Wide Charging Protocol Suite (WWCP) - Core

The World Wide Charging Protocol Suite is a collection of protocols in order to
connect market actors in the field of e-mobility solutions via scalable and secure
Internet protocols. This repository defines the fundamental core concepts, entities
and data structures.

WWCP comes with adapters to well-known e-mobility protocols like OCPP, OICP and OCPI.
Please note, that OICP is not a free and open protocol and therefore the adapter can
not be distributed as free open source software.

This software is developed by [GraphDefined GmbH](http://www.graphdefined.com).
