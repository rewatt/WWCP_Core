 - **WWCP Cloud** allows you to run a distributed and fault-tolerant EMP or CPO backend using WWCP, OCPI and the Intercharge protocol.
 - [WWCP OCPI](https://github.com/OpenChargingCloud/WWCP_OCPI) defines a mapping between WWCP and the [Open Charge Point Interface](https://github.com/ocpi/ocpi).

 - [WWCP OICP](https://github.com/OpenChargingCloud/WWCP_OICP) defines a mapping between WWCP and the Open InterCharge Protocol. Please note, that the Intercharge protocol is not (yet) a free and open protocol and therefore the adapter can not be distributed as free open source software. Nevertheless it is available as shared source for customers of [Hubject GmbH](http://www.hubject.com).
